# Pomodo Clock

I built this Pomodoro Clock as my final project in the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock) front-end library certification. The application really hammered home the concepts of using `useEffect`. Also, I liked figuring out how to use `setInterval` in React.
